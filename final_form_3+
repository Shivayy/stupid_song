When I'm with you I forget about them others
I only want you, i won't ever need another
We be rollin' round blunt cruisin' burnin' rubber v
I don't play by the rules
Game smooth as butter


It's when I'm with you,       (..)
It's when I'm with you___ 
Ah, yeah, it's when I'm with    you you you you
It's when I'm with y_o_u


Uh, I've always only wanted one thing in life,
and get my paper straight, 
and put all for my family in front of all the bright lights
That's why I be working and working 
more when they closin' 'em courtains 
for being on twitter lurking 
and i be rather be poppin' and pursuin', 
so please


Bring your day one
tonight with might burn the house 
let them mary go around,
keep it cherry, 
tell me is you down 
and burning berries and your berry is down,
'cause


When I'm with you I forget about them others
I only want you, i won't ever need another
We be rollin' round blunt cruisin' burnin' rubber
I don't play by the rules
Game smooth as butter


It's when I'm with you             {K}game smooth as butter
It's when I'm with you                game smooth as butter
Ah, it's when I'm with you you you you___
It's when I'm with y_o_u_

{K}    
    Look,
    Look you make me get better, 
    through our every endeavor 
    and look the palm we've built together 
    can never get sawed up, 
    cause you my type and I ain't the type to settle for less up, 
    I'm type to give all for the life you always wanted, yes sir, 
    and when we down we bless up, 
    don't even got to dress up, 
    when you with me-/- cause artificials, 
    shit, don't give me pleasure, 
it's bout time where I spin 
that's what I really treasure 
if it's easy I don't want it, 
looking the harder the better. 
     I love the feeling that I get when I'm with ya, 
it's similar to the feeling I got when i sip the elixir, 
getting tipsy off of whatever, they makes it a picture, 
     you know it's real when the second you leave I already miss your comeback v


When I'm with you I forget about them others
I only want you, i won't ever need another
We be rollin' round blunt cruisin burnin' rubber
I don't play by the rules
Game smooth as butter

It's when I'm with you_ 
It's when I'm with yo__u        [...]
Ah, it's when I'm with you_ you_ you___
It's when I'm with y_o_u_


Okay I'm lifeless, with advices, 
advice been on mind is, 
nothing but the right thing, 
but I left that, 
let me write this. 
Addicted to the bad 
pussy in my cab  v
  {K}yu should send'em back 
     need money for your lab 
Ah, yeah, I can't explain this feelin'
knowing that you got it and nobody else can steal it, 
got my spirit healing 
turn lies into believings,
yeah this vocal be the reason that my heart don't stop from beating,
am I wrong now?
Okay hold em now, 
tell me how I'm wrong?      (....)
     {K}I just like to free the minds and express myself by writing songs.      (....)
        They don't like the fact that I'm with you from dusk until the dawn        
        but i aint leaving, look, this is where i belong


When I'm with you I forget about them others
I only want you, i won't ever need another
We be rollin' round blunt cruisin' burnin' rubber
I don't play by the rules
Game smooth as butter

When I'm with you I forget about them others
