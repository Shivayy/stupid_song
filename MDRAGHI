I disappear again for the night
She took me from my bed sleeping
And I woke up into an empty room, broken walls, no light
I faintly hear my whispers getting louder, creeping

And honestly, I dont know if im coming home tonight
Cause im locked inside my mind, out of sight

I look and frantically search into empty stores
Looking for something
But only look into a mirror then hit the floor
To realize I see nothing
And i knock on broken doors
But they never seem to open
coming to the conclusion that im broken
And yeah then i see myself in red and blue, and purple


I line up the corpses I see every night
Cause since 10 years I'm used of watching me die
Standing on a hill, wish i could find the light,
But each night one death so he'll start to tie...


I see you again in the mirror smothering me
Telling me I'll never get home
cause if i try you'll break every bone
im just property, and thats how it's supposed to be
Looks me in the eyes, getting mad theres no feeling he can see,
deciding to put my face on the table, as a reminder i'll better not flee

But oh sorry my dear, in the end i wasn't so scared,
so finally i called someone who cared,
dad always said for someones dead you pay a price,
and so i got used seeing me die every night.
