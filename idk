egotistic or some shit


what a beautiful world to be
anything but, alone
i can't find a cure
im slowly loosing control
how am i supposed to feel
when nothing seems real
who am i supposed to be
when everything i love
falls away from me

Soften me once more 
with those mesmerizing eyes
Twist around your tongue
Clouding me with lies
I cut myself open
To give it all to you
Let you poison run through me
And you love it i know you do

Bling, bling high life, 
super skinny gold tights
Living in the fast lane, 
glowing black light
Blood-red smudge lips, 
turning tricks, telling lies
Everything and nothing, 
empty doll eyes

I've been tangled in a hunter's trap
Knowing that I wont make it back

Cold cash, cheap thrills, 
monkey see monkey do
Learning the hard way, 
what you've gotta do
Take a pill, close your eyes, 
too young to be so wise
You were someone's little girl 
once upon a time
I'm a bug in amber trapped in glass
The world outside me just beyond my grasp


Think before you leap, as you sow shall you reap


Next thing got down, smelling my own blood, waiting for a sound
Stuck at the block, hearing screaming... then i felt god
Doctor said i was fine, it was just fate cause it wasnt my time.



Are you, Are you, coming to the tree
--where they strung up a man they said who murdered three
  --where the dead man called out for his love to flee,
    -- where i told you to run so we'd both be free
       --wear a necklace of rope side by side with me
strange things did happen here no stranger would it seem
if we met up at midnight in the hanging tree



Im seeing me moving, but still feel like im far,
Run away bitch - 
wish i was the type to maybe open my heart,
said it from the start, 
shit its cold and its dark...
Hitting the ground, I am hitting the ground
escaping whats left, i aint tryna be found
say its my fault for dishonouring love?
but tell me all along i've been smart as a thug
I'm taking the chance you get no peace from me,
cause love rips yu apart, it so easy too see,
so damn young and naive, stop looking at me
cause thugs dont cry cant be waiting on me.




i love my pride more than me
because it'll always keep me company



Sometimes I feel caged
And I find it difficult to turn a page
People say it’s just my age and stage
Which makes me feel outrage

I get told I’m simply deluded
Which makes me feel excluded
As for once I wanted to feel included
But deep down I felt intruded

Harsh reality, 
the world is fully polluted
